# Task Manager App 🚀

A simple and responsive **Task Manager Application** built using **React + Vite**.
This project allows users to add tasks, assign priorities, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks dynamically.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was created to practice and understand the fundamentals of **React.js** including:

* Functional Components
* Props
* State Management using `useState`
* Event Handling
* Form Handling & Validation
* Conditional Rendering
* Dynamic Rendering using `map()`
* Component Reusability
* Tailwind CSS Styling

The app is fully component-based and follows clean React project structure practices.

# 🧠 Concepts Learned

## 🔹 React Concepts

### Functional Components

Created reusable UI components using functions.

Example:

* `TaskManager`
* `TaskList`
* `TaskItem`
* `AddTaskForm`

---

### useState Hook

Used `useState` to manage:

* Task list
* Form inputs
* Error messages

Example:

```js
const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([])
```

---

### Props

Passed data and functions between components.

Example:

```js
<TaskList
  tasks={tasks}
  deleteTask={deleteTask}
  changeTaskStatus={changeTaskStatus}
/>
```

---

### Event Handling

Handled button clicks and form submission.

Example:

```js
onClick={() => deleteTask(task.id)}
```

---

### Form Handling

Managed form input values using controlled components.

Example:

```js
value={title}
onChange={(e) => setTitle(e.target.value)}
```

---

### Form Validation

Implemented validation such as:

* Empty title check
* Minimum character length check

---

### Conditional Rendering

Displayed messages based on conditions.

Example:

```js
{tasks.length === 0 && (
  <p>No tasks added</p>
)}
```

---

### Rendering Lists using map()

Displayed tasks dynamically.

Example:

```js
tasks.map(task => (
  <TaskItem key={task.id} />
))
```

---

### State Updates

Learned immutable state updates using:

* `map()`
* `filter()`
* Spread operator (`...`)

---

# 📖 Component Explanation

---

## 1️⃣ AddTaskForm.jsx

### Purpose

Handles adding new tasks with validation.

### Learned

* Controlled inputs
* Form submission
* Validation logic
* Local component state

---

## 2️⃣ TaskItem.jsx

### Purpose

Displays individual task details.

### Learned

* Props usage
* Conditional styling
* Button event handling

---

## 3️⃣ TaskList.jsx

### Purpose

Renders all tasks dynamically.

### Learned

* List rendering
* Passing props to child components

---

## 4️⃣ TaskManager.jsx

### Purpose

Main component managing application state.

### Learned

* State lifting
* State management
* Component composition

---

# 🎨 UI Styling

Tailwind CSS was used for styling.

Concepts practiced:

* Flexbox
* Spacing utilities
* Responsive layout
* Hover effects
* Conditional styling
* Shadows and rounded corners

Example:

```js
className="bg-blue-500 text-white py-2 rounded-md hover:bg-blue-600"
```
